# Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project focuses on building and training a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using TensorFlow. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of neural networks, including the ReLU activation function, softmax function for multiclass classification, and the implementation of these concepts using TensorFlow's Sequential API.

## Project Overview

The project aims to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) into their respective classes. It employs a neural network with two hidden layers using ReLU activation and an output layer designed for multiclass classification. The softmax function is utilized for converting model logits to probabilities during the loss calculation phase for improved numerical stability.
